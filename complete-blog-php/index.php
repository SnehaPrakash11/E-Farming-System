      <p>India continues to be a country with the highest number of organic farmers in the world i.e. 8,35,000 with more than 1.5 million hectares under cultivation. Organic production has stimulated a dynamic market growth contributing to farm incomes and pushing food productions towards higher sustainability.

There has been a major improvement in soil quality which is helping farmers grow a variety of crops. Under Organic cultivation, there is zero use of pesticides removing any chemical threat to our Farmerâ€™s health and higher income (organic fetches about 15-20% more than conventional) giving them a better lifestyle. </p>
